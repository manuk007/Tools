1.SpeedControl_PWM_To_ESCs_V1.xlsx

Use this to understand what math we have to do in FC for ESC command.
For a given Battary Voltage and Motor KVA, A freq of between 0 to ~480Hz can be chossen to talk to PWM Escs Firmawares(ex : simonK)

So Set your Voltage (3s ~11.8) anf Motor KVA. Choose a freq of FC-ESC communication and set the duty cycles.
